following principals in the international market:
Messrs. Kouching Bvi Co. Ltd. of Taipei Hsien, Taiwan
Guangzhou Kuo Ching Office Furniture Co. Ltd China.
Messrs. Lopo Furniture Co. Ltd. of Guangzhou, China.

Office equipment and supplies are all high specs models and the furniture are quality incarnate but are affordably priced for every pocket in Ghana. There is no
question about their durability because our numerous customers: single buyers and companies who say so cannot be wrong. The durability of our furniture makes it so comfortable for us to give long-term warranties of FIVE (5) YEARS to our
numerous customers, the longest you can get on the Ghanaian market. Brochures of our proud designs of furniture are always incorporated in our profile for
customers’ own judgment.

On the local market we design and manufacture
general goods and services to customer’s specifications. A typical example is when JCL
Services manufactured Wooden Pallets for
COCOBOD when she won the contract to
supply a few years back.


PRICING
With the quality of our products and services, one might think it will be impossible to
deal with us, but our prices are most competitive and almost always negotiable.
Our payment terms have no equal on the local market as we always see from the
view point of our customers and deal fairly with them.
